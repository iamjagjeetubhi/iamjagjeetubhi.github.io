<p>Before starting reading this. Have a look at my previous blog</p>
<p><a href="http://wp.me/p7BooI-hv">Don't buy a HP laptop</a><br />
Today after following your all steps and wasting my time from 25th March. Thanks for breaking my laptop's body. And for wasting my time in name of service.Thanks for providing the technical support just by management team. Thanks for solving my problem without any technician. Thanks for ignoring the noise of my HDD I had sent you. Thanks for providing such high level of service just by costs the costumers very high amount. Thanks for everything you costs just by name of service. Thanks to <b>SYSNET GLOBAL, LUDHIANA </b>for being authorized service center of HP. Thanks to their manager for providing me the solution.</p>
