<p>Today, I have written a blog on <a href="https://iamjagjeetubhi.wordpress.com/2017/06/30/how-to-install-polr-in-ubuntu-16-04/">How to install Polr on Ubuntu 16.04</a>.</p>
<p>I takes time because I have installed it second time andÂ  there are some installation processes in which we are not clear during first attempt. During first attempt we force to make any software working and don't care on what steps we are using. So, to write a procedure to install any software we need to test the same procedure on different machines.</p>
<p>After that I read the code of <a href="https://github.com/jugrajsingh/GndecSMS">GNDEC sms app</a> and edited the URL to make it working.</p>
