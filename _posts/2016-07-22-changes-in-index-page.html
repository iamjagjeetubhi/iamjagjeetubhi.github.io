<p>The index page of multi-user plugin just came with login and sign in option. When ever I open the index page it shows login option but I want it to comes with option to short the URL for those who does not have an account. Finally I did changes. Now it is working&nbsp;<a href="http://urlslice.me">urlslice.me</a>&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
