<p>Today, I installed BIM Server on my Lubuntu. It was not working before in Ubuntu because it consumes too much RAM as compared to Lubuntu.</p>
<p>I installed the required plugins then created a new project.  I tried to query using Bimql plugin but it was giving the error. Then I followed <a href="https://fumblehool.wordpress.com/2017/06/27/querying-bim-server/">Daman's blog</a> to query the model. We can also download the result of query in a text file.</p>
