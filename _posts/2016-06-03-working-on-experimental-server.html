<p>Today, I worked on Experimental Server that teach me something about:</p>
<pre>$ sudo</pre>
<p>I logged into Experimental Server using:</p>
<pre>$ ssh iamjagjeetubhi@202.164.53.122</pre>
<p>But I was not able to open my server in browser using link:</p>
<pre>http://202.164.53.122/~iamjagjeetubhi/</pre>
<p>I was getting the error:</p>
<blockquote><p>403 Forbidden<br />
You don't have permissions to access /~iamjagjeetubhi/ on this server.</p></blockquote>
<p>I was continuously giving execution permission for others to public_html directory using:</p>
<pre>$ sudo chmod o+rx public_html</pre>
<p>and getting the error:</p>
<blockquote><p>"iamjagjeetubhi is not in the sudoers file.<br />
This incident will be reported."</p></blockquote>
<p>At last I came to know I don't have sudo power. So, I can't use sudo then I tried above command without sudo :</p>
<pre>$ chmod o+rx public_html</pre>
<p>Finally, it works and now I can see my public_html directory in browser :)</p>
