<p>I finally installed YOURLS on server. I got $50 at <a href="http://www.digitalocean.com">Digitalocean</a> using GitHub Student's pack. I bought a server first then register a free domain at <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a>. I found one with name <a href="http://urlslice.me">urlslice.me</a>. And finally it's working.</p>
<p>Now I decided to create a logo for <a href="http://urlslice.me">urlslice.me</a>. Then I have to edit Yourls Firefox and Chrome extensions with my own logo and name. After that I will edit the webpages design of Yourls.</p>
