<p>Today, I installed Lubuntu on my laptop. It comes with LXDE (Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment) and consumes only 500 MB of RAM after booting. where Ubuntu that comes with Unity consumes 1.5 Gb of RAM after booting.</p>
<p>After that I wrote a blog on <a href="https://iamjagjeetubhi.wordpress.com/2017/07/01/change-dpi-in-lxde/">Change DPI in LXDE.</a> then I started working on Android Studio for SMS app. I found an open source replacement to the stock messaging app on Android called <a href="https://github.com/moezbhatti/qksms">QKSMS</a> then started reading it's code. It uses Android SMSManager to send messages. I am able to send message using our sms gateway But along with SmsManager. I will try to disable SMSManager so the messages can be sent using our gateway.</p>
