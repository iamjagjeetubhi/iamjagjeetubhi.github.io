<p>Today, I installed open source URL shortener called <a href="https://github.com/cydrobolt/polr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polr</a> on experimental server. It is the alternative of <a href="https://github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YOURLS</a>. Unlike YOURLS we do not need any plugins for multiuser in Polr. We can use Gmail SMTP for verification of new user's email address. It has built in feature like Resetting the password, verification of the email address, admin panel (we can change role of user and can also see all the links created by all users). It provides different themes based on bootstrap.</p>
