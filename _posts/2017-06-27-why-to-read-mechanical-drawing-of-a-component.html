<p>Today, I got Raspberry PI 3 model B. I just bought it without a case and thought to make it by own. I think to put it between two pieces of plywood using screws.</p>
<p>It has four mounting holes and I bought 3 m.m(estimate) screws to mount it between plywood.</p>
<p>I was going to make holes on plywood by estimate. Just before I found the screws size is over than mounting hole on Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>Than I searched it's mechanical drawing and got the drawing.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/mechanical/Raspberry-Pi-3B-V1.2-Mechanical.pdf">Mechanical Drawing of Raspberry Pi 3 Model B</a></p>
<p>Now, I have complete dimensions and will make holes in plywood at exact positions in the morning. And will also buy screws for mounting.</p>
<p>So, It's compulsory to read structure of every component before doing some process over it. It can save your time.</p>
