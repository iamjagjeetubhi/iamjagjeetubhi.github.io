<p><b>URL shortening</b> is a technique on the <a title="World Wide Web" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web">World Wide Web</a> in which a <a title="Uniform Resource Locator" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator">Uniform Resource Locator</a> (URL) may be made substantially shorter in length and still direct to the required page. This is achieved by using a <a class="mw-redirect" title="URL Redirection" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_Redirection">redirect</a> on a <a title="Domain name" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name">domain name</a> that is short, which links to the <a title="Web page" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page">web page</a> that has a long URL. For example, the URL "http://example.com/about/index.html" can be shortened to "https://goo.gl/aO3Ssc". This is especially convenient for messaging technologies that limit the number of <a title="Character (computing)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_%28computing%29">characters</a> that may be used in a message, such as SMS, and for reducing the amount of typing required if the reader is copying a URL from a print source.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><a href="http://goo.gl">goo.gl</a></strong></span><strong>: </strong>Google’s URL shortener is sleek, simple and efficient. But that is to be expected from the internet’s powerhouse. Login with your Google account to get a rundown of all your previous shortened URLs along with a nice selection of statistics for that particular URL. View total clicks, referrers, countries and platforms.</p>
<p>Not all URL shorteners offer statistics, so it’s good to take advantage. If you are not signed in when using Goo.gl, you will be given the same shortened URL as someone before if you are both trying to shorten the same URL. This then doesn’t give you access to personal statistics for your URLs.</p>
